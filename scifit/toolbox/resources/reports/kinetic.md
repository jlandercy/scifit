# Report

The solver uses the Activated State Model theory to represent kinetic reactions
with input data formatted in a matrix fashion: rate monoms, reaction rate polynoms and
reaction polynoms quotients. Kinetics ODE system are notably stiff, albeit conditionning
and numerical stability are taken into account, jitter may happen  for some specific
set of parameters or at large time scale. Always keep your critical sense when inspecting
figures and tables.

## Model

The model is based on the following kinetics:

{{equations}}

Which are described by the following stoechiometric coefficients matrix:

{{coefficients}}

With initial concentrations vector:

{{concentrations}}

And kinetic constants vector:

{{constants}}

Time domain for solver is defined as:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rS}
$t_{\min}$ & {{tmin}} \\
$t_{\max}$ & {{tmax}} \\
$\mathrm{d}t$ & {{dt}} \\
$n$ & {{n}}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
